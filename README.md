Automatic Identification and characterization of images in articles in the medical literature
============================

To develop a search engine for images in medical articles, it is necessary to seperate images. Often images are not separated and presented to us, in one whole page picture (subfigures). The project aims to: allow to distinct between the different parts in the picture in the article ,and use it to detect if it contains sub-images (composite image) and make a separation to them. Another challenge will be: lowering  the "noise" (surroundings of a picture),and  the image characterization: Is this a medical image or not. These basic steps are the first step for further classification of images in a more accurate way.
